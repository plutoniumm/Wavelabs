    <h2>Sensor Suites: w/ Network Slicing</h2>
    Network Slicing allows us to run many more functions much more efficiently as per need of scale. Monitor
    whole plant miniscule tolerances for pre-emptive

            - **Nuclear**: Monitor Neutron Density, Rods insertion etc in realtime & calibrate before runaways
            - **Fossil Based**: Automatically manage for demand surges with more input by self driving wagon tipplers and trucks

            - **Geothermal**: Sensors can monitor for surges, empty pockets and depletions in realtime giving ample time to plan ahead
            - **Biomass**: Bulk Analysis of data is critical here due to many steps and heterogeneity of material involved. Sourcing data can be fed into computer directly via APIs to let machine decide optimum conditions before the actual mass even arrives
