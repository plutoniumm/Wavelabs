# Private 5G

For years, if an organization wanted to deploy a private wireless network at a factory, office building, transit hub, other facility, or over a utility service or other geographic area, its options were limited to Wi-Fi or proprietary network technologies like LoRa or Sigfox.

With coming of 4G LTE & more important 5G, businesses can now finally deploy private versions of 5G for themselves. This is made possible crucially due to 2 reasons
- Software defined technologies allowing usage of COTS hardware
- Usage of OSS allowing very low barrier to entry

## Bands
**Low Band**
- <1GHz
- 100s of sq km
- <300 Mbps

**Mid Band**
- <6GHz
- Few kms radius
- Low Gbps speeds

**High Band/mmWave**
- <2km radius today
- Mid &rarr; high Gbps speeds
