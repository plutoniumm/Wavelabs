# Current Problems
- Education via VC is problematic due to inability of network to take too much load and therefore videos cuts off or is jittery


## Solutions
### VC
5G will enable students to VC seamlessly and allow teacher to teach without concern of resolution or visibility. Students can also download classes faster and still do work at the same time

Possible because: Massive bandwidth of 5G

Ex: BITS Hyderabad has a system Impartus which records their lectures online. Students often have trouble downloading or streaming it due to internet constraints. This will now be solved

### Mixed Reality
Students can not only see remote locations such as labs and locations but also see simulations in realime with mixed reality. Say looking at the wind-flows of a fluid simulation around a car while standing next to it. Or exploring a lab/virtual lab in remote villages without having to build the facility itself

### Smart Campus
- Self Service food outlets
- Smart Parking
- Virtual Health Appointments
- Services monitoring for automatic ticket generation of things like water sanitation, air conditioning failure etc
- Sensors that track and schedule shared spaces for students.
- Autonomous transportation and delivery robots.
- Sensors that alert students when shared resources are free (computers, laundry, etc.).
- Contactless payment methods.
- Automated kiosks for food services.

### Security
- Motion and environmental sensors for sensitive areas
- (Very IMP) Geofencing and smart locks for improved access control between students and staff
- SIM provisioning for secure and reliable communication across the cellular network
- Digital signs and speakers for emergency alerts
- Automated lighting across campus
- Avoiding downtime due to unforeseen machine failures.
- Improved HVAC efficiency through environmental sensors and automation
- Improved efficiency of maintenance staff with advanced remote troubleshooting
