# 5G in Agriculture
## Current Problems
Yield per hectare in USA is `8.1 T/hect` whereas in India it is `3.2 T/hect` the main causes of which are
> - Average farm size
> - Poor infrastructure
> - Low use of farm technologies and best farming techniques
> - &darr; of soil fertility due to over fertilization &amp; sustained pesticide use
> ~ [GOI](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/agriculture-challenges-detail.html)

We will hope to tackle the boost in farm technologies with as little investment as possible. Due to very poor situation of farmers in India, technological intervention is possible only for Medium to Large scale farmers due to affordability concerns which is what we will target

## Methods

### Definations
Key Factors:
- Soil composition and moisture content
- Nutrient detection
- Location for precision
- Airflow

### Mechanisation
The main resistance of Indian farmers to mechanisation is initial cost and maintenance issues

We can resolve the maintainance issues problem very easily. All farmers can be given a central hub where they will monitor all their vehicles and preemptively correct any errors before they occur so issues like Overheating, Alkaline Battery, Inefficient Driving profiles can be basically corrected for before they get out of hand.

Use of 5G Here: **Large Volume Sensor data transmition i.e *CV2X*** \
Use Case Enabled: Using vehicles and smart harvesters for automation

### Weather Data on Dashboard
High bandwidth will allow farmer to pull weather data and predictions in realtime to accurately predict the next few days key factors

### Agricultural Sensors
Knowing beforehand the soil composition the farmer can decide accurately on how much water and fertiliser is needed and put more targeted amounts where needed more/less. This will help him save resources as opposed dumping them

He can also predict compositions of crops for best harvest. Say if the date of when wheat is between 14-20% is known to be 3 days later, farmer can secure deal before hand to use cash in other places

Knowing exact state of everything every second will also save on labour costs since individuals will not have to keep reexamining hectares of land every once in a while

### Statistics
Big data is slated to play a major role in smart farming, and the benefits percolate across the entire supply chain and the markets. Data can be from external sources such as social media, supplier network, markets, or from sensor/machine data from the fields. Transformation of agriculture from using big data is taking place that affects crop yield, supply chain management, yield prediction, etc

### Livestock Management
Use of chips and body sensors can help prevent disease outbreaks and are crucial in large-scale livestock management. Diseases in animals can be caught before they symptomise.

Chips and body sensors measure vital parameters and indicators that could easily predict a host of factors before hand, like say cows tend to walk more when in heat or horses tend to jump around when in distress etc.
